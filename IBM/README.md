# IBM

 - IBM is actively contributing to the Sigstore project and using it as an important service for  CI/CD technology. Sigstore provides useful capability in  building cloud-native applications on Kubernetes in our public and hybrid clouds
- We have invested Research  and development resources to contribute to sigstore in the areas of K8S and CD ( SBoM, K8s YAML )
-  By signing and verifying signatures of infrastructure configuration along with CI / CD artifacts, sigstore can play a vital role in software supply chain integrity
