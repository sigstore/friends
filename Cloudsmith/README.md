* [Cloudsmith](https://www.cloudsmith.com) is a cloud-native, hosted, private artifact repository with support for 28+ package formats, including Docker, RPM, Debian, Maven, Ruby, Node, NuGet, Dart, and Python. Cloudsmith was built to tackle the complexity of managing software assets- we want to make it easy for organizations to secure their supply chain at scale, including their open source dependencies.
* Sigstore has advanced signing and verification of open source artifacts. Here at Cloudsmith, we are actively working on extending our signing functionality to support cosign from sigstore as a method for signing and verifying open source images and blobs.
* In tandem with this work, Cloudsmith is working on a feature to allow customers to attach an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) to containers using cosign. Once hosted on Cloudsmith, the SBOM will be programatically available to customers who can then integrate SBOM validation into their software pipelines.
