* [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) is an enthusiastic participant in the sigstore community. As a leading provider of enterprise Kubernetes software through the [Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/) portfolio, we look to sigstore as an important set of tools for helping our customers better secure the software supply chain for modern applications.
* R&D staff are working on Tanzu solutions using Cosign, and we are spearheading Cosign integration into [kpack](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack), [Carvel](https://carvel.dev/), and [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/).
* [VMware Tanzu Application Platform](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-platform) is a modular, application-aware platform that provides a rich set of developer tooling and a prepaved path to production. We are utilizing cosign as our signing tool for developers, and policyt-controller from sigstore as our validation tool for the platform. Cosign helps to provide an irrefutable proof of the integrity and authenticity of the produced artefacts.
