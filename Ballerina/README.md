* [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) is currently working on automatic verification of the release artifacts and dependencies in the Ballerina Update Tool.
* [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) is looking to integrate signing in Ballerina packages in [Ballerina Central](https://central.ballerina.io/), Ballerina's package manager.
